# Azuki Airdrop

The $ANIME airdrop has already occurred as part of the token's launch on January 23, 2025. Azuki NFT holders were a significant part of the airdrop distribution. The $ANIME token aims to build a decentralized ecosystem for the anime community, with a substantial portion of the tokens allocated to community-driven initiatives.
